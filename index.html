        <h1>Chicken Cassoulet</h1>

        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>Chicken cassoulet comes from the French dish cassoulet. It was invented in <u><b>1355</b></u> in France. The story goes that the people in the city of
            <u><i>Castelnaudary</i></u> made a meal out of all of the food they had so that the soliders fighting in the war could continue fighting. My mom made chicken cassoulet a lot when I was little, 
            and she still makes it on special occasions. She makes a little differently than how it is traditionally, but it is one of my favorite family meals. </p>
